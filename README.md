## Packaging tutorial - PyCon US 2021

For most developers, Python packaging feels like a magical (and cryptic) black box. Apps and libraries use a variety of
tools and have different packaging challenges. Once you start reading up on this topic, you come across many seemingly
random components: `setuptools`, `pip`, `poetry`, `wheels`, `pyproject.toml`, `MANIFEST.in`, virtual environments,
`zippapp`, `shiv`, `pex`, and so on. The sheer number of concepts to master can be overwhelming, leading many
programmers to conclude that packaging in Python is a mess. Before you despair, join me in this tutorial session where
you'll have a chance to learn how to package and publish/deploy your library and/or application through hands-on
exercises.

### Topics

- How and why library packaging differs from application packaging?
- Differences between a source tree/source distribution/wheel.
- Differences between a build back-end and a build front-end (and why we even have this separation).
- Tools used for packaging your library.
- Tools and techniques used to package your application.
- Testing your package for correctness.
